            <h3>What is GIT</h3>
            GIT is a distributed version-control system for tracking changes in any set of files, originally designed for coordinating work among programmers 
            cooperating on source code during software development. Its goals include speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows

            <h3>Why is it used?</h3>
            GIT is tool which enables it users to work on projects and distribute the same among their co-workers. It saves the history of all the changes occured to the 
            and also the information of who made what changes. This can be used to bring the project back in time if something goes wrong.
